Version History

v0.11.0
=======

Changes:

* Update to use MTMount instead of NewMTMount IDL files.
  This requires ts_xml 7.1.
* Update to read telemetry from a TCP/IP socket in the low-level controller.
* Update TMA commander:

    * Move the code to a new TmaCommander class.
    * Rename the bin script to ``bin/command_tma.py``.
    * Add two camera cable wrap tracking sequences.
* Fix an error in `CommandFuture` that allowed it to try to set a done Future to a new state.
* Improve the way `MtMountCsc` enables and disables the low-level controller, as follows:

    * Leave the state at DISABLED if any command to enable the low-level systems fail, rather than going to a FAULT state.
      This leaves the telemetry client running.
    * Run all disable commands, even if one fails.
* Work around a bug in the AskForCommand low-level command by pausing briefly after issuing it.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for MTMount and MTRotator from ts_xml 7.1

v0.10.0
=======

Changes:

* Rename ``bin/zrun_mtmount_commander.py`` to ``bin/command_mtmount.py`` to match naming in other packages.
* Change the ``--log-level`` command-line argument to ``--loglevel`` for ``bin/run_mock_tma.py`` and ``bin/tma_commander.py``, to match the command-line argument for running CSCs.
* In simulation mode start the mock controller process just before connecting to the low-level controller, and terminate it just after disconnecting.
  This slows down the `start` command but allows recovery if something goes wrong with the mock controller.
* Improve error handling if a TCP/IP server cannot be constructed.
  This fixes a source of silent errors and a failure mode where ``run_mock_tma.py`` could not be terminated.
* Log more information in `Communicator` connection monitoring.
* Removed ``Commander`` enum; use ``Source`` instead with the `AskForCommand` command.
* Use ``pre-commit`` instead of a custom git pre-commit hook.
  See ``README.rst`` for instructions.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and MTRotator from ts_xml 7

v0.9.0
======

Changes:

* Update the `MTMountCsc` to send the ``ASK_FOR_COMMAND`` low-level command when going to ``ENABLED`` state.
  Only send device initialization and shutdown commands if the CSC has command.
* Add more commands to the TMA commander.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2

* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and MTRotator from ts_xml 7

v0.8.0
======

Changes:

* Update to use and require ts_xml 7.

    * Use MTRotator's ``rotation`` telemetry topic instead of Rotator's ``Application`` telemetry topic
      (in the camera cable wrap following code).
    * Improve use of MTMount telemetry in the same code.
      Adjust the camera cable wrap position to match the camera rotator timestamp,
      and use what are likely better fields for that position.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and MTRotator from ts_xml 7

* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.7.3
======

Changes:

* Fix a bug in the close method of the mock controller.
  It would try to close the communicator even if was still None.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.7.2
======

Changes:

* Fix a bug that prevents the CSC from starting the mock TMA controller.
* Added missing ``enable`` constructor argument to `MTMountCommander`.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.7.1
======

Changes:

* Fix the requirements information in the version history for v0.6.0, v0.6.1, and v0.7.0.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.7.0
======

Changes:

* This release requires ts_salobj 6.
* Simplified the simulation mode support, using ts_salobj 6-specific features.
* Added class attribute ``version`` to `MTMountCsc`.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 2
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.6.1
======

Changes:

* Fix bin/run_mtmount.py so that it works with ts_salobj 6 (and 5).
* Add a unit test of bin/run_mtmount.py.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.15 or 6
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 1 (with salobj 5) or 2 (with salobj 6)
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.6.0
======

Changes:

* In simulation mode have the `MTMountCSC` run the mock controller in a subprocess,
  in order to give the CSC a better chance of keeping up with tracking commands.
  This eliminates the `MTMountCSC.mock_controller` attribute.
* Add `MTMountCsc` constructor argument ``run_mock_controller``
  to control whether the CSC runs the mock controller in simulation mode
  (if false then you must run the mock controller yourself).
  This supports unit tests that need access to the mock controller --
  access that is difficult if the CSC runs the mock controller in a subuprocess.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.15
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm 0.9
* ts_idl 1
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

v0.5.0

* Send camera cable wrap tracking commands in advance, by a configurable duration.
* Make the CSC enable camera cable wrap tracking when first enabled.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.15
* ts_simactuators 2
* ts_hexrotcomm
* ts_idl
* IDL files for NewMTMount, MTMount, and Rotator from ts_xml 4.8

* ts_hexrotcomm
