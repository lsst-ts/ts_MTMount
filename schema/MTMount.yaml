  camera_cable_wrap_advance_time:
      description: >-
        How far in advance of the current time to make the tai time field of camera cable wrap
        tracking commands (sec). All tracking commands must sent to the low-level controller in advance,
        so it can interpolate between pairs of tracking command. If a tracking command is late then
        the controller will halt the axis. Set this value large enough that camera cable wrap
        commands reliably arrive in time, despite variation in speed of the Python CSC.
        Avoid making it much larger than required, because it introduces a delay in motion
        of the camera cable wrap, which can cause too large an error between the camera rotator
        and the camera cable wrap when the rotator is offset or slewed to a new field.
